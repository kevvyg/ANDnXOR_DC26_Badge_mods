# ANDnXOR_DC26_Badge_mods

Adds "auto multi-bling" function and two Flames blings.  Copy contents in SD to the appropriate paths.


  BTW This is the "auto multi-bling" code @kevvyg posted about here
  BTW https://twitter.com/kevvyg/status/1024682631244464128
  BTW It disables looping, so you may need to manually loop very short GIFs. Dirty, horrible hack.
  BTW Would not be so dirty if RICK ROLL accepted an integer for loop as opposed to WIN or FAIL 
  BTW You must hold down the left button until you exit for blings that use this. Dirty, horrible hack.
