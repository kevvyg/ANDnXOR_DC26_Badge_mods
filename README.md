# ANDnXOR_DC26_Badge_mods

Adds "auto multi-bling" function and two Flames blings.  Copy contents in SD to the appropriate paths.

This is the "auto multi-bling" code I posted about here:  https://twitter.com/kevvyg/status/1024682631244464128

It disables looping, so you may need to manually loop very short GIFs. Dirty, horrible hack.
Would not be so dirty if RICK ROLL accepted an integer for loop as opposed to WIN or FAIL 
You must hold down the left button until you exit for blings that use this. Dirty, horrible hack.
